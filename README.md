### Hi there 👋

I'm Nathaniel Knight; call me Nat.

My pronouns are he/him. ♂

I have a website at [nathanielknight.ca](https://nathanielknight.ca). 🌐

In addition to what you'll find here, I have a bunch of open source code over on [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/nathanielknight). 🪣

I live on the West Coast of Canada 🇨🇦 on the territory of the Songhees, Esquimalt and W̱SÁNEĆ people. 🐢

I currently work as a software developer for [Robots and Pencils](https://github.com/robotsandpencils). 🤖

When I was a boy, I played the Violin and Viola. 🎻

I'm always happy to talk about:

- board games ♟
- sailing ⛵️
- [roguelike deck builders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike_deck-building_game) 🃏
